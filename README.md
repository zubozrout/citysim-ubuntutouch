# CitySim

[CitySim game for Ubuntu Touch](https://uappexplorer.com/app/city.zubozrout)

## Development

The easiest way to get setup with development on CitySim is using
[clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable). Once clickable is installed
just run `clickable` from the project's root directory and it will build the
click package and install it for testing on your connected device.
